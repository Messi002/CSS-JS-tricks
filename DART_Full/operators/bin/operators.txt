There are 4 types of operators in dart: 
-Unary_prefix
--,++(mutates and returns new value), !(doesn't mutate the old value and returns a new value),
~(unary_bitwise_complement_prefix_operator; it flips 0s to 1s),-(doesn't mutate the value),
-Unary_postfix(e.g. age--)
--(the value is mutated but returned thesame value again)
-Binary_infix
-,==,+,*,/,%,~/,!=,>,<,>=,<=
(There's an overload of + operator in dart; there are two functions but with different args)
-Compound_assignment
~/=(does a truncate and reassign the new value back to the variable, *=,+=, &=,|=,`=,-=,??=)
